## üöÄ Getting Started

If you're new to Pipe PoP nodes, we recommend starting with the [SETUP_GUIDE.md](./SETUP_GUIDE.md) document, which provides a comprehensive guide to setting up your node.

## üîå Port Configuration

The Pipe PoP node requires ports 80, 443, and 8003 to be open. For detailed information about port configuration, see the main [README.md](../README.md#-port-configuration).

## üåê Global Command Overview

The global `pop` command allows you to manage your node from anywhere on your system. For a complete list of available commands and usage examples, see [GLOBAL_COMMAND.md](./GLOBAL_COMMAND.md).

## üîÑ Checking for Updates and Updating

The Pipe PoP node includes functionality to check for updates and update the binary when new versions are available:

```bash
# Check for updates
pop --check-update

# Update to the latest version
sudo pop --update

# Force reinstall a specific version
sudo pop --update vX.Y.Z --force
```

When you check for updates:
- If your node is already running the latest version, you'll be informed that no update is needed.
- If a new version is available, you'll be provided with information about the new version and instructions on how to update.

When updating:
- The system automatically creates a backup of your current binary before updating.
- The new binary is verified before replacing the old one.
- The Pipe PoP service is automatically restarted after updating.
- You can force a reinstall of the same version using the `--force` flag if needed.
