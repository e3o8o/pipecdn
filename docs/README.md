## Getting Started

If you're new to Pipe PoP nodes, we recommend starting with the [SETUP_GUIDE.md](./SETUP_GUIDE.md) document, which provides a comprehensive guide to setting up your node.

## Global Pop Command

The global `pop` command is automatically installed during setup and allows you to manage your node from anywhere on your system without having to navigate to the installation directory.

```bash
# Check node status
pop --status

# Monitor node performance
pop --monitor

# Create a backup
pop --backup
```

For more details, see the [GLOBAL_COMMAND.md](./GLOBAL_COMMAND.md) document.

## Using the Surrealine Referral Code

When setting up your Pipe PoP node, you can use the Surrealine referral code to earn additional rewards:

```bash
sudo pop --signup-by-referral-route 3a069772281d9b1b
```

## Managing Your Node

After installation, you can manage your node using the global `pop` command from anywhere on your system:

```bash
# Check node status
pop --status

# Monitor node performance
pop --monitor

# Create a backup
pop --backup
```

For more details, see the [GLOBAL_COMMAND.md](./GLOBAL_COMMAND.md) document.
