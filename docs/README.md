## ðŸš€ Getting Started

If you're new to pipe-pop, we recommend starting with the [SETUP_GUIDE.md](./SETUP_GUIDE.md) document, which provides a comprehensive guide to setting up your system.

## ðŸ”Œ Port Configuration

The pipe-pop requires ports 80, 443, and 8003 to be open. For detailed information about port configuration, see the main [README.md](../README.md#-port-configuration).

## ðŸ”Œ Global Command

The global `pop` command allows you to manage your node from anywhere on your system. It can be installed in two ways:

```bash
# Method 1: Create a symbolic link (recommended)
sudo ln -sf "$(pwd)/pop" /usr/local/bin/pop

# Method 2: Use the installation script
sudo ./install_global_pop.sh
```

For a complete list of available commands and usage examples, see [GLOBAL_COMMAND.md](./GLOBAL_COMMAND.md).

## ðŸ“¦ Installation Options

pipe-pop can be installed through multiple distribution channels:

1. **One-Line Installer**: `curl -fsSL https://packages.pipe.network/downloads/install.sh | sudo bash`
2. **APT Repository**: For Debian/Ubuntu systems
3. **YUM Repository**: For Fedora/CentOS systems
4. **Direct Downloads**: AppImage, DEB, RPM, and source packages
5. **GitHub Releases**: All package formats available on GitHub

For detailed information about installation options, see [DISTRIBUTION.md](./DISTRIBUTION.md).

## ðŸ”„ Checking for Updates and Updating

The pipe-pop includes functionality to check for updates and update the binary when new versions are available:

```bash
# Check for updates
pop --check-update

# Update to the latest version
sudo pop --update

# Force reinstall a specific version
sudo pop --update vX.Y.Z --force
```

When you check for updates:
- If your node is already running the latest version, you'll be informed that no update is needed.
- If a new version is available, you'll be provided with information about the new version and instructions on how to update.

When updating:
- The system automatically creates a backup of your current binary before updating.
- The new binary is verified before replacing the old one.
- The pipe-pop service is automatically restarted after updating.
- You can force a reinstall of the same version using the `--force` flag if needed.

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Your Node

The pipe-pop includes several tools for monitoring your node:

```bash
# Check node status
pop --status

# View detailed uptime statistics
pop --stats

# Real-time pulse monitoring with different modes
pop --pulse                   # Standard mode (exit with 'q')
pop --pulse -i                # Interactive mode (exit with any key)
pop --pulse -c                # Continuous mode (exit with Ctrl+C)

# Comprehensive dashboard
pop --dashboard               # Full dashboard with auto-refresh
pop --dashboard --refresh 10  # Refresh every 10 seconds
pop --dashboard --export HTML # Export dashboard to HTML file
```
