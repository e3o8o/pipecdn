   - Referrals and rewards commands (`--gen-referral-route`, `--points`)

5. **Documentation**
   - `README.md`: Basic overview
   - `GLOBAL_COMMAND.md`: Global command documentation
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`: Implementation summary
   - `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`: Development tracking
   - `REPUTATION_SYSTEM.md`: Reputation system explanation
   - `REFERRAL_GUIDE.md`: Referral system guide
   - `articles/`: Detailed implementation articles

6. **Installation Packages**
   - AppImage: Universal Linux package format
   - DEB: For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
   - RPM: For Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS-based systems
   - Source package: For manual installation

## Current Status

The implementation is complete:

- ✅ Directory structure created
- ✅ Scripts developed
- ✅ Documentation written
- ✅ Systemd service file created and installed
- ✅ Service enabled and started
- ✅ Monitoring script tested
- ✅ Backup script tested
- ✅ Solana CLI installation (completed)
- ✅ Solana wallet configuration (completed)
- ✅ Configuration with Solana wallet (completed)
- ✅ Actual Pipe PoP binary installation (completed with v0.2.8)
- ✅ Improved port usage monitoring
- ✅ Regular backup schedule set up (weekly)
- ✅ Port configuration (80, 443, 8003) completed
- ✅ Service running successfully with proper registration
- ✅ Global pop command implemented
- ✅ Wallet management features added
- ✅ Port enabling option added
- ✅ Node ID consolidation implemented
- ✅ Multi-format installation packages created
- ✅ Repository renamed from 'pipecdn' to 'ppn'

## Next Steps

1. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Continue regular monitoring
   - Monitor for updates to the Pipe PoP binary
   - Ensure ports remain properly configured

2. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Develop web-based dashboard for node management
   - Implement enhanced analytics for node operators
   - Create mobile notification system for alerts
   - Develop multi-node management tools

## Testing Results

Testing with the actual binary shows:

- Node successfully starts and creates node_info.json
- Monitoring script correctly detects node status
- Cache directory is properly used
- Service file is correctly formatted and works
- Systemd service starts and runs correctly
- Backup script successfully creates backups
- Solana wallet successfully configured
- Configuration file correctly integrated with the binary
- Binary version 0.2.8 is running correctly
- Port usage monitoring provides clear information
- Weekly backup schedule successfully set up
- Port 8003 is actively used by the node
- Ports 80 and 443 are configured and active
- Wallet management features work correctly
- Node ID consolidation works correctly
- Installation packages successfully created and tested

## Conclusion

The Pipe PoP node implementation is complete and follows best practices for Linux service deployment. The Solana integration has been completed successfully, with the wallet configured for use with the node. The actual Pipe PoP binary (v0.2.8) has been installed and is running correctly as a systemd service. 

The node is fully operational and ready for production use. Regular maintenance tasks have been automated with a weekly backup schedule, and the monitoring system provides clear information about port usage and system resources.

The global `pop` command provides a convenient interface for managing the node from anywhere on the system, with features for checking status, managing the wallet, configuring ports, and performing maintenance tasks. The documentation has been updated to reflect all the new features and improvements.

Multi-format installation packages (AppImage, DEB, RPM, and source) have been created to make installation easy across different Linux distributions. The repository has been renamed from 'pipecdn' to 'ppn' for the public release.
