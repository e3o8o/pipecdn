# Pipe PoP Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the Pipe PoP node.

## Contents

- Log files with timestamps in the format: `pipe-pop_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- Each log file contains output from a single run of the Pipe PoP node

## Viewing Logs

There are several ways to view the logs:

1. **Using the pop script**:
   ```bash
   ./pop --logs
   ```

2. **Using systemd journal** (if running as a service):
   ```bash
   journalctl -u pipe-pop.service -n 50
   ```

3. **Directly viewing log files**:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/pipe-pop_*.log
   ```

4. **Filtering logs for errors**:
   ```bash
   grep ERROR logs/pipe-pop_*.log
   ```

## Log Rotation

Log files can grow large over time. Consider implementing log rotation to manage disk space:

```bash
# Example log rotation configuration (add to /etc/logrotate.d/pipe-pop)
/home/user/Workspace/PipeNetwork/logs/*.log {
    daily
    missingok
    rotate 7
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    create 0640 user user
}
```

## Important Notes

- Check logs regularly for errors or warnings
- High disk usage by logs may indicate a problem
- The log level can be configured in `config/config.json`
- When reporting issues, include relevant log excerpts
